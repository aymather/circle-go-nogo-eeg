		dot moves for 50ms per point on circumference on the wheel, then changes color for the 50ms, then changes back to original color, then keeps moving for the other half of the "wheel time".
		the color change "point" should fluctuate between the middle 20%-30%. 

		Ring shows up (before dot appears) = waitSecs(500ms)
